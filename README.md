TetraMorph
==========
A WIP game based on my Squares.js repo

You can try it out here:
http://bentles.github.io/TetraMorph

Controls
---------
- left click to split a square
- right click to flip a square
- shift + left click to merge squares
- esc to pause

How the game works
-----------
The game will constantly generate patterns of squares of increasing complexity. Your job is to recreate the pattern before your time runs out. You do so using three operations. You may split any square into 4 smaller ones. You may merge 4 small sqaures into a large square, and you may flip over a square to change its colour.

How to win
----------
Unfortunately you're out of luck here. You cannot win this game. Your aim is to survive. Currently there is no fail state but the plan is that you will collect squares by correcctly recreating patterns and then lose them when it's too difficult for you to keep up.
