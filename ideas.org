* Ideas for tetramorph
** Switch between more than 2 colours a possiblility to make the game harder
*** Colour Selections?
- I'd assume keep as close to colour Scheme currently
  in use. (Shades of Green?)
*** Max number of different colours?
- Thinking 5 as a Max. Discuss, lel
- How many possible colours to allow at any one given
  time? (Ie. Allow 3-5 colours per round, or max it
  at 3 or something)
*** At what point is a new colour added?
- Set it at a Score Point Mark? Or a number of completed
  rounds?
  EG:
  Score:
  5k  = 3 Colours
  10k = 4 Colours, etc.

  Completed Tiles:
  50  = 3 Colours
  100 = 4 Colours, etc.
** Remove Points for missing a Game Square
- Reaching 0 (or less) Score, results in Game Over
- Logic to the Idea/Process:

  After missing a Square, remove 'X' Points. Any 
  Subsequent Miss, results in losing DOUBLE the
  previous Point Deduction.

  25 > 50 > 100 > 200 > 400, etc.
- Display if you are in danger - you can't survive another miss  
** Random Mode (Random Power-Up)?
- Every now and then, perhaps mark a Square as a
  'Power-Up' Square. Completing this Square could 
  create a Temporary (Trippy) colour Scheme (Idea 
  to make harder to play, but provide double the points?)
- Possibility of Added additional Effects?
  - Waving Screen
  - Music Change? (When Implemented)
** Mystery Squares? 
- (Square marked with '?' which is only revealed near the end of 
  the Path (near end of Round) implying need for quick reactions.
